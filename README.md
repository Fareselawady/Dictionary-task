Dictionary Word Sorter
📌 Project Overview
Dictionary Word Sorter is a high-performance C# console application designed to efficiently categorize words based on their characters using a Dictionary<char, List<string>>. By processing a given text input, the program systematically organizes words under their respective starting letters, enabling structured word retrieval and analysis.

This project demonstrates efficient data structures, string manipulation, and dictionary-based storage techniques in C#.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Optimized Word Categorization: Organizes words dynamically based on their first letter.
✅ Case-Insensitive Processing: Converts all characters to lowercase for uniform sorting.
✅ Efficient Data Storage: Leverages Dictionary<char, List<string>> for fast lookups and insertions.
✅ Minimal Processing Overhead: Uses an optimized loop structure to enhance performance.
✅ Scalable Implementation: Easily extendable to support additional text-processing functionalities.

🛠️ How It Works
1️⃣ Text Processing: The program takes a predefined text input.
2️⃣ Word Extraction: The input is split into words using whitespace as a delimiter.
3️⃣ Dictionary Storage: Each word is stored in a dictionary, grouped by its first letter.
4️⃣ Output Generation: The program displays categorized words in an organized format.

📌 Example Output
